This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library (rpart)
```


```{r}
iris = (iris)
iris
```


```{r}
Tc = rpart (Species ~., data = iris)
Tc
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
#Construct maximal tree:

Tc=rpart (Species~., data=iris, control = rpart.control (cp= 10^(-15), minsplit = 2))
Tc
```

```{r}
P= predict (Tc, type = 'class')
V= iris$Species
V
```

```{r}
#Calculate the error:
error = sum (V != P)
error
```

```{r}

#Maximal tree for cars dataset
cars = (mtcars)


cars
Tr = rpart (mpg~., data = cars, control = rpart.control(minsplit = 2, cp = 10^(-15)))
Tr
```
```{r}
#calculate the error
Vr=mtcars$mpg
Pr=predict (Tr)
err2=sum ( (Pr-Vr) ^2)
err2
```


```{r}
#alpha values
Tr$cptable
```

```{r}
#pruning:

C= Tr$cptable
T1=prune (Tr,cp=C[24,1])
T2=prune (Tr,cp=C[23,1])
T3=prune (Tr,cp=C[22,1])
T4=prune (Tr,cp=C[21,1])
T5=prune (Tr,cp=C[20,1])
T10=prune (Tr,cp=C[15,1])
T11=prune (Tr,cp=C[14,1])
T12=prune (Tr,cp=C[13,1])
plot (T10)

```
```{r}

```{r}

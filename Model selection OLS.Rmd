#Building the full model: 
M1 = lm (target_deathrate ~., data= Cancer_m)
summary (M1)
```

```{r}
plot (M1)
```










```{r}
#Testing for Gaussianity of the noise:
Rs = rstudent(M1)
Rsc = rstudent(M1)
Rst =rstandard(M1)
plot (M1$fitted.values, Rs)
ks.test (Rst, 'pnorm')
ks.test (Rsc, 'pt', nrow (Cancer_m)-ncol(Cancer_m))
#Noise is not gaussain
```


Noise is not Gaussian, we cannot use the Fisher criterion



```{r}
#Selecting variables 
StepAIC_M = stepAIC (M1, direction = 'both')

```



```{r}

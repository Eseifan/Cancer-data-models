This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library("dplyr")
library(MASS)
library ('glmnet')

```


```{r}
Cancer <- read.csv('/Users/hazemeseifan/ASML/cancer_reg.csv')

Cancer_m2= na.omit (Cancer [, -c(9, 13, 17,24)])
Cancer_m2


```




```{r}


CV_lambda = cv.glmnet(x=as.matrix(Cancer_m2[,-3]), y = Cancer_m2 [,3], alpha= 1)
CV_lambda
best_lambda = CV_lambda$lambda.1se

M6 = glmnet(Cancer_m2 [,-3], Cancer_m2 [,3], alpha = 1, lambda = best_lambda)
M6$beta
#We git min (the lowest lambda), and the 1-standard error (1se)-rule lambda.  Nonezero is the number of non-zero coifficients
```



```{r}

#Ok let's try this: hello???

M_final = lm (target_deathrate ~  incidencerate + povertypercent+ medianagemale+ pcths18_24 + pcths25_over + pctbachdeg25_over  + pctunemployed16_over+ pctprivatecoverage + pctpubliccoveragealone  + pctotherrace + pctmarriedhouseholds + birthrate, data= Cancer_m2)

```


```{r}

plot (CV$cvm, ylim = c (381,383))

```


```{r}
#Build the model with the min lambda but it is not a correct model)
M6 = glmnet(Cancer_m2 [,-3], Cancer_m2 [,3], alpha = 1, lambda = 0.0377)
M6$beta

```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
